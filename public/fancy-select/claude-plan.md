Populate the `<select>` in `index.html` (in this directory) with programming languages that would be somewhat familiar to a web developer audience.

This uses the new customisable select feature, so the content of the `<select>` can be advanced.

Group them in `<optgroup>`, with the sections being things like "Config files", "Markup languages", "Scripting languages", "Transpiled languages" etc etc.

Each option should have the name of the language, preceeded by a span containing the appropriate char from seti.woff. See icon-theme.json for the chars and their colors. Use an inline style to set the color on the span. No not use the 'light' color.

Do not add items that are not represented by a seti.woff icon char in icon-theme.json.

Do not attempt any other styling at this point.
